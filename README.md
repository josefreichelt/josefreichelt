## Hello there 👋

My name is Josef Reichelt and I like to code things.  
Checkout my page at [josefreichelt.github.io/](https://josefreichelt.github.io/)  
I'm a web frontend developer with 5 years of working experience in **React** but my passion and focus is game development.  

Currently I enjoy exploring making games from scratch as much as possible with **C++**.  

What I love the most:

- My son 👦
- My wife 👱‍♀️
- Games 🕹
- Listening to movie and game OST 🎧
- Game development 💾
